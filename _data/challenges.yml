	impact_stories: The MyPlate Fruits and Veggies Video Challenge is likely to increase the long term availability of consumer-friendly nutrition promotion tools available to the public. The Challenge drew attention to the consumer message ”Make Half Your Plate Fruits and Vegetables” by encouraging the general public and youth to share the message in a creative, custom, and targeted way and expands the many ways in which programs, partners, schools, and communities promote the Dietary Guidelines for Americans. Beyond the promotion and distribution achieved during the competition itself, the videos can be used as part of subsequent efforts to promote MyPlate, fruit and vegetable consumption, healthy eating, and wellness among private and public organizations. The videos will continue to be available through YouTube to extend their accessibility to the public. The Center of Nutrition Policy and Promotion creates resources to help professionals, educators and intermediaries extend the reach of nutrition information and education. The MyPlate Fruits and Veggies Video Challenge meets the mission of the Center and provides long-term resources for those wishing to engage audiences in creative and practical ways.

	impact_stories: Through this competition, OSH was able to focus on youth tobacco prevention and promote the release of the 2012 Surgeon General’s report. Using video as a creative outlet, young people personally engaged with the report findings and educated their peers about the dangers of tobacco use. Winners were interviewed by local newspapers and asked to perform their songs or show their videos at their local high schools, churches, and events. Tobacco prevention and control partners with winners from their states have requested copies of their videos to show in presentations and for their web and social media efforts. The U.S. Surgeon General has featured winning videos in her talks and presentations about the 2012 Surgeon General’s report, since she officially announced the winners during a live Twitter chat in May of 2012. All videos can be viewed from the CDC Office on Smoking and Health competition web page.

	impact_stories: 
	outcome_notes: The competition web site and subsequent online marketing materials were written to present the requirements for submissions, to encourage participation, and to educate the public on the Million Hearts™ initiative and heart disease prevention. Results from tracking social media activity show these posts led over 2,500 people to the competition web site throughout the submission period from July 16 to August 31, 2012. These social media messages, viewed by over a hundred thousand “followers” of CDC social media, were often shared by other Federal agencies and national partners who have thousands of their own followers. Despite the low number of submissions, the winning videos successfully provided tips on how to prevent and control high blood pressure and described the role of a family caregiver. The first place winner, in particular, used an innovative approach through motion info-graphics to describe how a caregiver helps a loved one maintain their heart health.

Scripting, shooting, and editing two-minute promotional videos costs, on average, about $10,000. The ONC Health New Year Video Challenge received 47 eligible video submissions – potentially $470,000 worth of promotional material and 94 times the $5,000 in prize money awarded. The winning videos combined were viewed over 4,438 times.

	impact_stories: Contest #1 ($4,000 total) First Prize ($1,500): Home Energy Score API A proposal to integrate Home Energy Scores into home sales and rental listings. This could make it easier for families to factor energy efficiency/costs into their decision about which home to choose. Second Prize ($1,000): Intelligent PV Selection that Considers Usage, Rates and Size A proposal to combine Green Button data, utility rate information, and estimated solar performance information from the Department\'s PVWatts tool to create an accurate assessment about the most cost effective type of solar installation and rate plan for a given home or building. Third Prize ($500): The Transparent Cost Database Enables Energy Innovation A submission containing several ideas for using and improving the data contained in the Department\'s Transparent Cost Database, a tool collecting and standardizing historical and projected cost estimates for a variety of energy technologies. Popular Choice ($1,000): Online Forum to Make Financial Energy Incentives More Effective An idea to combine the list of incentives in the Database of State Incentives for Renewables and Efficiency with a forum or other similar software allowing citizens to ask questions about various incentives and get advice on how to apply from fellow citizens and potentially program administrators. Contest #2 https://cio.gov/doe-america-competes-to-build-the-best-energy-app/ In the last two months, the Energy Department ? in partnership with our Presidential Innovation Fellows ? sponsored a series of hackathons across the country to encourage the creation of energy-related apps for consumers and expose the tech community to some of our most powerful datasets, standards and tools. The hackathons were held in Washington, D.C., San Diego, Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, Boston, and Los Angeles as part of Contest 2 of the American Energy Data Challenge, sponsored by the Office of the Chief Information Officer, Office of Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy Reliability, and Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability. The hackathons are part of the Energy Department?s efforts to introduce the public to our Application Program Interface (APIs) and Green Button data ? as well as the best ideas from Contest 1 of the American Energy Data Challenge. The Washington, D.C., hackathon was held at local startup incubator 1776 and brought in 108 people building apps in 12 teams. The winner used Green Button data and mapped home energy use onto the Zillow.com real estate database as a means of comparing the energy efficiency of houses listed for sale. In San Diego, the winning team developed a demo that monitors energy consumption in devices inside a typical home using adapters purchased from Best Buy. The app monitored electricity used as compared to a budget the user set up on their cell phone for each month. When energy use got too high, the consumer automatically received a text asking if they?d like to make a series of proactive changes to reduce use to stay within their target budget. In Valley Forge, the hackathon was held at the PJM Interconnection headquarters and a team built an app called ?Incentive Finder? that allowed a user to enter their address, then quickly and easily find federal, state and local energy reduction incentives and local companies they could work with to help them make changes to save energy. In Boston, hack/reduce in Kendall Square hosted 40 people who formed nine teams. The winning team developed an app called ?PowerMarketa? that will enable consumers to potentially save hundreds of dollars or more a year on energy. With this app, customers submit their detailed Green Button data to over 250 licensed suppliers in the state of Massachusetts. Those providers then bid on supplying the customer with electricity.
